# Open Authentication
A Minecraft plugin that authorizes players to enable 2FA via Discord.

## How it works? ⚙️
Works like any other authentication plugin has something special, the next command:
```/2fa <discord_id>```
This allows players to enable a 2FA authentication with his current Discord account.
And when he rejoins and login with a correct password a message will be sent to him throught discord
 with a code that he'll have to enter into the Minecraft chat.
